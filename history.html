		<div class="history">
			<p>The origin of sushi is believed to have been during the second century A.D. in Southeast Asia because of the need to keep meat fresh without refrigeration. They would cure meat and fish and wrap it in rice to preserve its freshness. It was then left to ferment for several months. If the meat and fish were treated this way, it could be preserved for several months longer than being cured alone. Eventually, when enough time had passed, they would discard the rice and eat the cured insides.

				About ten centuries later, people started adding vinegar to their sushi to aid in the fermentation process. This way, they didn't have to wait so many months for the sushi to be ready.

				In the 1820's, chefs started using raw fish in their sushi, known as Edo-style sushi. This is the style you will find in most sushi restaurants.

				Nearly 100 years later, when Tokyo was dominated by food service stalls, vendors invented nigiri-sushi, or raw fish placed atop shaped rice. This type of sushi is sometimes referred to as "hand sushi" because of its portability. After World War II, the use of street stalls to sell fish decreased in favor of more sanitary indoor conditions, but the nigiri-style remained.

				In the past 20 years, as sushi is being recognized as a healthy alternative, sushi restaurants have flourished in the United States. Rolls like the California Roll, which is made with cucumber instead of fish, were introduced to Westerners who might be weary of the idea of sushi.

				Today, thanks to mass production and globalization, sushi is a common meal in many parts of the world.

				<h1 class:"types-of-sushi"> Types of Sushi </h1>
				<p>There are four styles of sushi that are commonly seen in the United States: maki, nigiri, sashimi and chirashi. 

				Maki: Maki-style sushi is the "roll" type of sushi. The sushi ingredients are rolled in rice, seaweed or a vegetable and then cut up into bite-size pieces. Often more meat, vegetables or masago are placed on the top of the roll, then sauce is drizzled over the top. Many sushi restaurants make specialized rolls with their chefs' creations. The creative possibilities are endless.  

				Nigiri: The word nigiri literally means grasped or squeezed--the rice is molded into a shape and then fish is placed on top, often held together with seaweed. This makes it easy to pick up and eat with your hands, which is why it is sometimes called "hand sushi." Nigiri-style became popular in the early 19th century in Japan, when street vendors were a big part of the food industry. A bowl of different styles of sushi.  

				Sashimi: Sashimi consists of slices of sushi-grade fish and regular steamed, boiled or sushi rice on the side. The most common types of fish served in sashimi-style sushi in the United States are salmon and tuna.  

				Chirashi: Chirashi is sort of like sashimi-style sushi: it is slices of sushi-grade fish over a bowl of vinagared sushi rice, as opposed to having plain rice on the side. </p>
